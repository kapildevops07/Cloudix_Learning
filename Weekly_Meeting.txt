======================== Weekly Meeting ========================
19-April-2022:
Last Week:
	- Argo CD implementation for mediguru dev environment
		- We faced ingress issue. While deploying ingress to k8s cluster, it is not redirected to argo cd api server
		- This issue get resolved by adding "--insecure" flag to argocd server [URI: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/2953]

Current Week:
	- Argo CD pods are not showing in UI while deploying using argo cd manifest
		- This issue is due to project manifest, where in only allowed resource at namespace level is visible in UI
	- Deploy argocd for mediguru dev environment
	- Use Dependentbot to update packages for md-payment-service branch development
